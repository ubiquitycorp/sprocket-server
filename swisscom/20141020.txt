DE619: We had an issue with the build server that was due to the repositories
getting too large and unwieldy, causing the createrepo to take forever. In
addition, rather than running createrepo every 5-10-20 minutes, we modified
the jenkins configuration to have it run automatically on demand at the end
of a jenkins build.

I have a defect filed in addition that requests a two week pruning of the build
server.  I will work on that today.

US528:TA2035: This is a general "catch-all" that covers getting the sprocket
environment up and running in the swisscom cloud.

US528:TA2036: I will work on this tonight. This is a howto showing start
to finish how to get the swisscom cloud up and running to its current state,
which is slightly off nominal but may be small application-related issues that
I am not an expert on.

US528:TA2139 and TA2140: I branched the repo from develop last week, so we 
have a modified settings.xml for both sprocket-server and sprocket-web that
point to the servers.  These do not take advantage of load balancing at this
time but we can work on that later, after the demo.

US528:TA2141: Each instance in the swisscom cloud is now aware of the RDS
instance and can reference the database at mysql://sprocket-rds:3306.  There
appear to be issues with jdbc that are beyond the realm of my knowledge that
are affecting its ability to connect, but that may be an app issue.

US528:TA2142: This is complete.

US528:TA2143: Sprocket-web definitely works but there are issues with the
application connection that manifest as timeouts.  I sent these to Chris to
get his help

US528:TA2156: This is waiting for Chris to parameterize the build_server module
and there are still some other items that I have to back into the puppet
configuration for the build server.

US528:TA2157: This is complete.  Ping tests work and respond with the pong
message.

US528:TA2159: I work on this and TA2036 tonight and have them into the wiki
soon.

US528:TA2160: This is complete.  The database now gets its sprocketusr
account created and permissions granted from a puppet script that runs.

US528:TA2188: This is waiting for Chris
